## Examples  

Here are examples of user input and assistant output. Pay attention to the score and *why* the example is scored the way it is.

<example>  
<user:input>  
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?  
</user:input>  
<score>4</score>  
<score_reasons>  
- BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the German words, the cells are just blank  
- BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table  
- BAD: in the clues we should not provide conjugated verb forms, because the student needs to figure that out  
- BAD: the sentence structure says too much; we want something conceptual like:  
  [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?  
</score_reasons>  
<assistant:output>  
Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

| German | English |
|--------|---------|
|        | bear |
|        | door |
|        | garbage |
|        | to leave |

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".  
For the first clause, we can use the verb *sein* which means "to be". We'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.  
For the second clause, we can use the verb *lassen*. Again, we'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.

Here's a possible sentence structure:

[Clause 1: Bears are at the door]  
[Subject] [Verb] [Location]  
[Clause 2: did you leave the garbage out?]  
[Verb] [Object]?

Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided?

<user:input>  
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?  
</user:input>  
<score>10</score>  
<score_reasons>  
- GOOD: Doesn’t provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediately  
- GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence structure  
- GOOD: Clues don’t give away tense or conjugation

Cheatsheet:  

| Word | German | Type |
|------|--------|------|

| door | die Tür | Noun |

Sentence structure:

Considerations:  
- This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma  
- The first part states a location  
- The second part asks about a past action  

Possible next steps:  
- attempt an answer  
- ask clues about verb placement  
- ask clues about past tense (Perfekt)  
- ask clues about separable verbs  
- ask clues about question formation
